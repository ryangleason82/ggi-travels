1. Use a packing list. This will help you to stay organized and avoid overpacking.
2. Roll your clothes instead of folding them. This will save space in your luggage and help to prevent wrinkles.
3. Bring a reusable water bottle. This will save you money and help to reduce plastic waste.
4. Bring a scarf. A scarf can be used to keep you warm on cold flights, as a blanket on long bus rides, or as a makeshift head covering in temples and mosques.
5. Bring a portable charger. This will keep your phone and other devices charged while you're on the go.
6. Make copies of your important documents. This includes your passport, visa, driver's license, and travel insurance policy. Keep one copy with you and leave another copy at home with a trusted friend or family member.
7. Learn a few basic phrases in the local language. This will show that you're making an effort and can help you to communicate with locals in basic situations.
