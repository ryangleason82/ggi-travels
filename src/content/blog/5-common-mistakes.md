1. Overpacking: One of the most common travel mistakes is overpacking. This can make your luggage difficult to carry and can also lead to baggage fees. To avoid overpacking, make a packing list and only bring the essentials.
2. Not booking flights and accommodation in advance: If you're traveling during peak season, it's important to book your flights and accommodation well in advance. This will help you to get the best deals and avoid disappointment.
3. Not having a backup plan: Things don't always go according to plan when you're traveling, so it's important to have a backup plan. This could include having a copy of your important documents, knowing how to get around in an emergency, or having a list of alternative accommodation options.
4. Not learning a few basic phrases in the local language: Learning a few basic phrases in the local language will show that you're making an effort and can help you to communicate with locals in basic situations.
5. Not being prepared for the weather: It's important to check the weather forecast before you travel and to pack accordingly. This will help you to avoid being caught off guard by bad weather.
